# Ideas for new buttons

In this page, we will keep adding new ideas for buttons. The purpose behind this is if someone has a good idea but is unable to implement it, they can add it here and others can look through this document and try to implement these ideas.

When adding ideas, please add them in the right category (or add a new one if you can't find a fitting category) and add some explanation to your idea if necessary.
